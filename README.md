This is my first random dice game that contains three dices which  is one of them is loaded. I've tried some new things, honestly everthing in this area is new to me.
I've learned that from ,"Turkcell Gelecegi Yazanlar" -Unity Lessons. I am going to push to Github that other implementations I've learned. 
If you're experienced in this field, please feel free to give me advices and correct my codes. It would be a big favour to me. Thanks for reading this.
